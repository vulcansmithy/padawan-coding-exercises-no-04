## Coding Exercises No. 04
1. Go through the [String ruby documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/String.html) and look for a method or function that prepends or combine one string to another string. Using said method prepend the string "```Learning ```" to the string "```Ruby```".

2. Go through the [String ruby documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/String.html) and look for a method or function that remove characteres from a string. Using said method, it turns the string "```Learning Ruby```" into the string "```Lrnng Rby```".

3. There is a String ruby method that allows to justify a string, padding it with another string. Find said method and use it on the string "```Ruby```" together with "```<3```" so that you get the following string result:  

```ruby
"Ruby<3<3<3"
```

4. Create a ruby application called exercise_04.rb. Fill it in  with the following lines:

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# your code here... 
```

So that, when you run  your code, e.g., ```ruby exercise_04.rb```, you get the following output  


```ruby
5
```

5. Copy ```exercise_04.rb``` to ```exercise_06.rb```, then open this new file. Add another line before the line that you just added, so that, when you run your code you get the following output:

```ruby
99
```
